# Specials Board Color Scheme


This is a Sublime Text implementation of Coda 2's "Specials Board" colour theme.

It's optimised for PHP, HTML, CSS/SASS/SCSS and Javascript.

The PHP, HTML and CSS/SASS/SCSS are a pretty close match with Coda's version. The Javascript isn't as close... from what I can tell, it's impossible to target Javascript variables and some other language constructs in Sublime's color scheme files, so you don't have as much control as you'd want.

## Notes

Use the 'scope hunter' plugin for ST2 to help with editing themes and finding the right scope paths. Particularly, the 'toggle instant scoper' option.
