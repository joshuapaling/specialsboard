Specials Board Color Scheme
=============

This is a Sublime Text implementation of Coda 2's "Specials Board" colour theme.

I've jsut forked it from @milsyobtaf and then made a few tweaks to make it more to my liking, including:

* Slightly darker backgorund colour
* Bright blue for current line highlight, and selection highlight (I find it really annoying to have these settings anything less than bright, clear, and immediately obvious)
* possibly more tweaks in future.
